}"  I have a problem. I have two images when the door is opened and when it is closed. 
The condition is that when the player's beam approaches the door with a height of 2.5, 
I place an image of the door open, but when I approach the door from the sides,
 there is a beam here that is larger than the other beam, so the two images, 
 opening and closing, are drawn at the same time.
